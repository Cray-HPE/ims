  description: >
    The Image Management Service (IMS) creates and customizes
    boot images which run on compute nodes.
    A boot image consists of multiple image
    artifacts including the root file system (rootfs), kernel and initrd. There are
    optionally additional artifacts such as debug symbols, etc. 

    IMS uses the open source Kiwi-NG tool to
    build image roots from compressed Kiwi image descriptions (recipes).
    Kiwi-NG is able to build images based on a variety of different
    Linux distributions, specifically SUSE, RHEL and
    their derivatives.

    A user may choose to use the Cray-provided recipes or 
    customize Kiwi recipes to define the image
    to be built.

    IMS creates and customizes existing boot images and maintains metadata about the images
    and related artifacts. IMS accesses and stores the recipes, images, and related artifacts
    in the artifact repository. 

    ## Resources 

    ### /images 
      
      Manipulate ImageRecords, which relate multiple image artifact records together.

    ### /jobs  

      Initiate image creation or customization.  It creates the image which it uploads to 
      the artifact repository,
      and maintains associated metadata in IMS for subsequent access. It also customizes a pre-existing
      image.

    ### /public-keys

      Manage the public keys which enable ssh access. 
      Public-keys are created and uploaded by the
      administrator to allow access to ssh shells provided
      by IMS during image creation and customization.


    ### /recipes 

      Manipulate the RecipeRecord metadata about the Kiwi-NG recipes 
      which are stored in the artifact repository. 
      Recipes themselves define how an image is to be created including the
      RPMS that will be installed, the RPM repos to use, etc. 
       

    ## Workflows

      There are two main workflows using the IMS - image creation and image customization.  
      The IMS /jobs endpoint directs the creation of a new image, or 
      the customization of an existing image, depending on the POST /jobs request body parameter, job_type.
    
    ### Add a New Recipe

    #### GET /recipes 
       
      Obtain list of existing recipes which are registered with IMS.

    #### Upload recipe using CLI
       
      Upload a new recipe to the artifact repository using the cray artifacts command, if necessary.
      Refer to Administrator's Guide for instructions.
      
    #### POST /recipes
    
      Register new recipe with IMS. 

    ### Manage Public Keys
    
    #### GET /public-keys
    
      Obtain list of available public-keys.
       
    #### POST /public-keys
    
      Add a new public-key.

    ### Create a New Image
      
    #### GET /public-keys
    
    Get a list of available keys.
      
    #### GET /recipes
    
     Get recipe id.
      
      #### POST /jobs
      
      Use Kiwi-NG to create a new IMS image and image artifacts from a recipe,
      Specify job_type "create" in JobRecord. 
      Request body parameters supply the recipe id and public key id.
      Upon success,
      the artifact repository contains the new image and the image artifacts,
      IMS contains a new ImageRecord - metadata for the new image.
      During the creation process, IMS may create an ssh shell for
      administrator interaction with the image for
      debugging, if necessary.  (enable_debug = true in JobRecord)

    ### Modify an Image
      
    #### GET /public-keys
    
    Get a list of available keys.
      
    #### GET /images
    
    Obtain a list of available images registered in IMS.
      
    #### POST /jobs
    
      To create a modified version of an existing IMS image, 
      specify job_type "customize". Specify the IMS id of the existing image, and
      public key.  This request creates a copy of the existing image,
      and then an interactive ssh shell
      in which to modify the copy of the image.  Upon success,
      the artifact repository contains the original image and a modified version of it. IMS contains 
      a new ImageRecord - metadata for the modified image.
      The original image is still intact.  A user may want to install additional software, 
      install licenses, change the timezone, add mount points, etc.

        * Fetch recipe from the artifact repository and decompress to temp directory.
        * Wait for PRS to make required package repositories available.
        * Call kiwi-ng, which builds the image root using
          the recipe in artifact repository and accesses packages in zypper/yum repositories 
          provided by PRS. 
        * Upload the new image to the artifact repository, and save metadata to IMS - ImageRecord.
        * If there is a failure, establish debug ssh shell, depending on value of enable_debug.  Admin
          can inspect image build root.
          **touch /mnt/image/complete** in a non-jailed environment or
          **touch /tmp/complete** in a jailed (chroot) environment to exit.
        
        # Customize
        
        * The artifact_id in the POST /job request body refers to an IMS ImageRecord. IMS uses 
          the ImageRecord to read the Image's manifest.yaml to find the Image's
          root file system (rootfs) artifact.  IMS downloads the rootfs from the artifact
          repository and uncompresses it. 
        * IMS creates an ssh environment so admin can inspect and modify the image.
          For example, it may be necessary to modify the timezone, or
          modify the programming environment, etc.
          **touch /mnt/image/complete** in a non-jailed  
          environment or **touch /tmp/complete** in a jailed (chroot) environment.
          to exit.
        * IMS waits for the user to exit the ssh, then creates new IMS image
          record with the modifications, and adds the root
          certificate to the image. Note that IMS does not modify the original image
          but modifies a copy of it.
        * IMS creates a new IMS ImageRecord, packages the IMS artifacts
          (kernel, initrd, rootfs), creates a manifest.json manifest file, and uploads
          all new artifacts to the artifact repository. The metadata is recorded by IMS
          and ImageRecord is updated.
